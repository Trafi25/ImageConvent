# Lab 1 - Converter
(but we named it as Conventor) (???)

## Some info

A small note, at the beginning we wanted to work with Jpeg and Bmp. But Jpeg didn’t live up to our hopes in the end (it didn’t EARN) we had to bury it, so we write ppm. =(

### How it work

The application can only translate from * bmp * to * ppm * format due to the difficulties encountered.

### HOW TO USE

To run the application, you need to write the following line replacing the address of the source file:
```
Conventor.exe --source=D:/Ñ#/compGraf/Image/1.bmp --goal-format=ppm

```



###It just work =D
